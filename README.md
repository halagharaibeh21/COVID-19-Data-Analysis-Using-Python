# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between COVID-19 infection rates and global happiness factors.  
Using Python, we analyzed COVID-19 datasets and combined them with the World Happiness Report to study possible correlations.  

## Key Steps
1. **COVID-19 Data Analysis**  
   - Processed and visualized COVID-19 infection data.  
   - Examined trends across countries and regions.  

2. **Happiness Data Analysis**  
   - Used the World Happiness dataset, which includes factors such as GDP, health, freedom, and social support.  
   - Cleaned and prepared the data for comparison.  

3. **Correlation Study**  
   - Compared COVID-19 infection rates with happiness indicators.  
   - Investigated how factors like economy, health, and social support relate to pandemic outcomes.  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualizations  

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to understand how global happiness factors may be linked to the severity and spread of COVID-19, offering insights into the impact of societal well-being on crisis resilience.
